# user-plugin-plausibility-experiment

Experiment with the plugin for the modular version of the famous Open Source https://github.com/buerokratt/Ruuter for third party

Based on the https://github.com/buerokratt/Ruuter fork from the BÃ¼rokratt project - Events orchestrator to define business logic steps as YAML-based configuration files

We are going to refactor the yaml part and replace it with a classic third-party plugin system - to create a third-party marketplace of possible digital business opportunities ðŸ˜Š But also to support other data sources in different EU regions.

This is not the work of the Buerokratt authors, but an MIT licensed public domain motivation
